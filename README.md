# Time Series Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on time series data. The analysis focuses on Tesla's stock prices and airline passenger data, providing insights into trends, seasonality, and stationarity.

Time series analysis is essential for understanding trends and patterns in data over time. This notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of two time series datasets: Tesla stock prices and airline passengers.

Data Visualization: Time series plots illustrate trends and patterns in the data.
Stationarity Testing: The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is used to check if the time series data is stationary.
Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation: ACF and PACF plots are generated to understand the relationships within the time series data.
